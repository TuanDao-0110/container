# A. Containers:

### `1. Introduction`

- Containers encapsulate application into a single package. 
- Containers prevent application inside from accessing files and resources of the device. 
- As Containers are relatively lightweight, at least compared to virtual machines, they can be quick to scale. 
- AWS, Google Cloud and Azure all support containers in multiple diffrent forms.
